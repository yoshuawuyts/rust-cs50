# rust-cs50
Back in uni I learned C by doing Harvard's CS50 course. Now I'm learning Rust
and I figured I might as well progress doing the same exercises using a
language built for the same purpose.

## psets
### pset1
- run basic cli commands (ls, cd, lang compilers)
- print to stdout
- read from stdin, basic math, write to stdout
